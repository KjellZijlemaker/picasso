http://isis-data.science.uva.nl/strezoski/omniart/omniart_official/


## Meeting 16-03-2019
- Think about scenario's wich shows best what we have right now
- Add radio-like timeline
- Remove buttons and add nicer ones on side
- Less static points on globe transitions (like earthquakes)
- Clicking on bar, circles highlighted or paintings popping up
- Show art epidemics with migrations
- Add legend 
- Merge all


## Meeting 08-03-2019
- Take functionalities from 2d map and put them in 3d
- Create navigation bar and also use legend
- Create fold/unfold button which will allow map transforming to globe
- Make sure that the 2d migration flows work so we can transform from 3d to 2d and show migrations
- When hovering on cluster, subset paintings will show up and when clicking on them all paintings show up in new screen
- Create some use cases
- Use resized images set / add died born artist

## Meeting 01-03-2019
- Knowledge in lectures are good addition. Creating visualization aspects such as shapes, colors etc are a good addition 
- 3D as an extra, but nice addition for ending demo 
- Think about navigation bar
	- Clicking on one element will show more elements
- Colors can also be based on textures

To do:
- function that loops through data and adds data on globe dynamically
	- Choose what best showcases / usecase
- Globe on screen, plot points on globe instead of map.
	- Dark background, gloomy globe, elements pop up
	- Nicely designed with interactions user and transitons
- Remove legend for now
- Think about how different colors convey meaning
- Map out all styles, genres that have been created.
- Add when artists died and when they were born
- Don't overlap multiple lines very important, optimal path does not really matter

- To summerize it all for next iteration: create a globe where elements pop up dynamically based on the timeline, looking visually appealing





## Meeting 28-02-2019
- grade dependent on visualization itself
- First version is good
- If it doesn't work -> fail
- Splash screen
- turn on /off Layers with control panel for solving cluttering
	- Choose what user wants to see
	- Opacity, animation speed, line thickness
	- sentiment analysis can be interesting, per continent color 
- Read nested block model again
